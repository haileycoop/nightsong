You live on Ondra, a lush, abundant world, full of natural wonders and ancient ruins. Life here enforces its right to sprawl wildly. And you are in the way.

Ondra is the only home your people have ever had. And yet, it is wilful and creative in its attempts to destroy you. Monsters visit often. Disasters are expected.

Many great civilisations have risen here, some lasting millennia. Few have managed to leave a visible mark. The wilds of Ondra crash on them like a wave, wearing away their defiant corners and proud towers.

Right now, that matters little. You quietly watch the night sky with a peaceful mind. The dark world Vard looms on the night horizon. It is a great black disc, most easily seen because of the the simmering stars it blocks. 

It would be easy to think that Vard must be home to harsher horrors than Ondra, if it were not for this moment. In the middle of every night, when Vard it is at its apogee, Ondra seems to quiet and still. The ancestors say that if you listen deeply, you can hear Vard singing.

It is Nightsong, the gentle hour. At Nightsong we wake from sleep to share the stillness, and tell hopeful stories of the home that we haven't yet made.

How will you make a future for yourself, and your people, in the wilds of Ondra? What nightsong will you sing?
