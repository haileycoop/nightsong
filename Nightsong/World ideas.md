# Winning idea

- An entire solar system flees a dying or corrupted galaxy
- There is a dark gas giant in the solar system which is home to a long lived advanced civilisation like the Dwellers
	- It was a wormhole inside it? Maybe a last hope to save the home galaxy?
	- Or maybe not fleeing, just connecting up wormholes between galaxies?
- The gas giant has many moons
	- Maybe one is static at L2
	- Unsure if other bodies in the solar system
	- The moons are home to other intellligent species
- On the way out they accidentally capture a strange wandering planet
- Seems to be holding a strange power
	- Does it come to life under the new sun?
- At some point, this becomes the world we are adventuring on
- Maybe there have been attempts to colonise it that failed so it's still "young"
- Want to have a sense of "strange people over there that no one has met"
- Also skywhales that can travel between moons / worlds when they are close (maybe skywhales are the dwellers)
- Pull some vibes from the Bec campaign - spirits, drawing energy from the world itself - a bit of new She-Ra
- But also there needs to be enough history that different races and factions are co-existing on the planet
- But they also don't know their own history
- There needs to be some sort of reason why they've become disconnected from their origin
	- The Dwellers definitely not very helpful, communicative - happy to let the other races be
- Big surprises like the "stars" are actually galaxies because we are in intergalactic space
# My Ideas

A young world that is actually old. Each time the world is "refreshed" it is wiped clean and turned into a garden of Eden. The "gods" create new ancestries, and if they succeed in ascending technologically, they become like gods and join the pantheon, participating in the next cycle.

A young world that is on a moon surrounding a gas giant that is filled with Dwellers who have a wormhole inside like in the Algebraist. Various ancient civilisations can come through the wormhole to influence this world.
