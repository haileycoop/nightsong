Hello, you are my worldbuilding partner. I am preparing a Pathfinder RPG campaign in a fresh homebrewed world. Please help me by generating ideas and options, asking useful questions, and responding to my requests

I will provide some parameters. Please provide 3 or more distinct pitches for the world in which the quest will take place. A pitch should be just a few sentences. Please vary theme and tone.

- Pathfinder adherence: most of the races, classes, spells, and items should fit into this world. I don't want to have to do much adjusting of what is in the books, and I don't want to tell players "no" too much
- Magic level: Magic is rare to be able to use, but common to have seen. Famous wizards are known of
- Medieval fantasy fidelity: It's primarily fantasy, but it's ok to blend in some sci-fi and steampunk. But keep it escapist. Don't make the challenges and enemies in the world too analogous to problems players have to face in real life.
- Simulation: The players like keeping track of things. As the gamemaster, I'm also interested in a level of simulation. This doesn't necessarily affect how the world is designed, but it may mean different kinds of world feel more possible.
- Comedy: not too much joking around or silliness, but some is ok
- World age: On this point, we are open to a young world or an old world. But as the gamemaster, I like to create a "puzzle box" for players to solve
- Politics: If this is a 1: Good and bad guys clear cut; not many factions, nations. And this is a 5: Deception and intrigue are the norm. Countless factions, nations. We want a 3.
