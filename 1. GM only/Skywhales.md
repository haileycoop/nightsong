An ancient species living in gas giants. They are similar to the Dwellers in The Algebraist by Iain M. Banks. They are isolationist, slow moving, but highly technologically advanced.

They are the ones that set the [[The Vellar System|Vellar System]] on its escape course, using powerful space-warping technology. Maybe it was to escape the threat, or help the humanoids escape, or because they want to bring the wormhole portal at the centre of [[Var]] across the galactic void.

Skywhales are able to travel short distances in space without any protection.

The Skywhales were surprised by the arrival of [[Ondra]] / The Wanderer. They visited it and inspected it, but were very wary of getting close. They were content to study it from a far, and let the humanoids risk their lives exploring it.
