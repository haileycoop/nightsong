The strange and magical planet on which our adventures takes place.

It was called "The Wanderer" by the refugees from the Milky Way, which decayed into "Ondra" during the Fall.

Ondra is earth-sized, for ease of world-building. The [[Humans|humans]] particularly were pleased to see it.

It is deeply magical, whatever that may mean. It is full of creative power. It can seem almost intelligent. It defends itself against any and all incursions by sending monsters that in some way reflect the dark impacts of those who try to colonise it.

The humanoids over time became honed in their ability to fight, kill, and even hunt the monsters. The learned to derive magic from the slain monsters, increasing their ability to survive. Ondra's every attempt to reject them only strengthened them.

Other humanoids learned to live in closer harmony with Ondra. Ondra would then reveal this harmony in the form of spirits that would interact with the humanoids, sometimes granting them insights and magic.

As the humanoids deepened in their relationship with Ondra, harmonious or antagonistic, sometimes gods coalesced. By the time of the Churn, these gods became as plentiful and storied as the Pathfinder gods - with the same names and domains, for ease.

[[Dragons]] and [[Kobolds]] are native to Ondra and possibly existed independent of the arrival of the humanoids.

Some new races may have been created during the Fall or the Churn, by the gods, magical accident, or other means.
